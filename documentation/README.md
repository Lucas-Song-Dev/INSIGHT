# Documentation

Project documentation is grouped here. Keep it up to date with code changes.

## Convention

When you update any document in this folder:

1. Add at the **top** of the file:
   - **Last updated:** \<date (YYYY-MM-DD)\>
   - **Git commit:** \<short or full hash of the commit that introduced the change\>

2. Commit the doc change in the same commit as the code change when possible, or in an immediate follow-up commit, and set the "Git commit" line to that commit hash.

This keeps documentation traceable and makes it clear when each doc was last revised.

## Contents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [test-oracles-results.md](test-oracles-results.md) | Test oracles verification results and phase summaries (regenerate, user-scoped products, subreddit indexing). |
